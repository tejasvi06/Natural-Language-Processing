# Text Classification and Aspect-Based Sentiment Analysis using Transformer-based Models

## Overview
This project focuses on performing sentiment analysis and aspect-based analysis of Amazon product reviews using Transformer-based models. The goal was to achieve high accuracy in sentiment prediction and gain insights into various aspects of customer feedback.

## Objectives
- Fine-tune Transformer-based models (BERT and ALBERT) to achieve accurate sentiment classification.
- Extract and analyze aspects within product reviews using spaCy.
- Apply advanced data preprocessing and feature extraction techniques.
- Optimize model performance through hyperparameter tuning and cross-validation.

## Technologies and Tools
- **Models**: BERT, ALBERT
- **Libraries**: spaCy, NLTK
- **Techniques**: Sentiment Analysis, Aspect Extraction, Data Preprocessing, Feature Extraction
- **Validation**: Hyperparameter Tuning, Cross-Validation

## Installation
To replicate this project, you will need the following Python libraries. Install them using pip:

```bash
pip install transformers
pip install spacy
pip install nltk
```

## Steps

### 1. Data Preparation
- **Prepare the Dataset**: Gather and organize the Amazon product reviews dataset for sentiment analysis.
- **Preprocess the Data**: Use NLTK and spaCy to clean and preprocess the text data, including tokenization, lemmatization, and removing stop words.

### 2. Model Training
- **Fine-Tune Models**: Train BERT and ALBERT models on the preprocessed dataset to adapt them for sentiment classification.
- **Sentiment Prediction**: Use the fine-tuned Transformer-based models to predict the sentiment of the reviews.

### 3. Aspect Extraction
- **Identify Aspects**: Utilize spaCy to extract and analyze various aspects and entities mentioned in the reviews to gain deeper insights.

### 4. Evaluation
- **Model Assessment**: Evaluate the performance of the models using accuracy and other relevant metrics.
- **Optimization**: Perform hyperparameter tuning and cross-validation to improve the modelâ€™s performance and ensure robust results.

**Results**

Achieved 90% sentiment prediction accuracy on Amazon product reviews.
Successfully extracted and analyzed various aspects of reviews.
